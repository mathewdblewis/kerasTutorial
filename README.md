This is a demo on how to use tensorflow keras.  
I have adapted it from here: https://machinelearningmastery.com/save-load-keras-deep-learning-models/  
However I have split the code into multiple files so you can prepare data
build model, run model and test model seperately.

To use it, download all the files, then run demo.sh  
This will build the directory for the data and the model and populate it  
By looking at the files, hopefully it is somewhat self explanitory how to modify  
them so as to use your own data
